## Overview
#####
In this tutorial you will develop an application that will allow users to **create** and **join** different chatrooms. Allowing you to **send** and **recieve** messages to and from a multitude of users in **real time**!
#####
External Tools that you will be using are:
 1. [Socket IO Client](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client-swift)
 2. Node server that has already been created! Which you can view [here](https://github.com/Make-School-Labs/Make-ChatRooms-Backend)!

 This tutorial will require that you read instructions very carefully and follow them step by step. You might encounter errors that you will need to troubleshoot and google to solve. If you would like to provide feedback on this tutorial, please leave GitHub issues on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/matthewharrilal/Make-ChatRooms-Tutorial/tree/matthew/tutorial-pages/P00-Getting-Started).

 ## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to ... 

1. Learn the relationship between client and server when establishing a socket connection!
2. Become more comfortable with delegate flow, when passing data through views!
3. Implement real time messaging within your application!

## Using Git/Github
As you go though this tutorial you will be making substantial progress towards creating chatrooms and messaging others! It would be a shame if that progress were to be lost. To avoid this, be sure to make regular commits to your github repo containing the project. By implementing version control for your application not only are you helping yourself in detecting bugs during states of your application but also strengthening your engineering practices!
