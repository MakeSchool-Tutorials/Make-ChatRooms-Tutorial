## Overview
#####
In this tutorial you will develop an application that will allow users to **create** and **join** different chatrooms. Allowing you to **send** and **recieve** messages to and from a multitude of users in **real time**!
#####
External Tools that you will be using are:
 1. [Socket IO Client](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client-swift)
 2. Node server that has already been created! Which you can view [here](https://github.com/Make-School-Labs/Make-ChatRooms-Backend)!

 This tutorial will require that you read instructions very carefully and follow them step by step. You might encounter errors that you will need to troubleshoot and google to solve. If you would like to provide feedback on this tutorial, please leave GitHub issues on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/matthewharrilal/Make-ChatRooms-Tutorial/tree/matthew/tutorial-pages/P00-Getting-Started).
